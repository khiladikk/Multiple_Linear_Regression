# Multiple Linear Regression:

Multiple linear regression is the most common form of linear regression analysis. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable

Just like simple linear regression it is also used as a predictive analysis, the multiple linear regression is used to explain the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables(x1, x2, x3, x4… etc). The independent variables can be continuous or categorical.


## The model for MLR, given n observations, is:

```
Yi = B0 + B1xi1 + B2xi2 + ... + Bpxip + E where i = 1,2, ..., n
```

Where yi = dependent variable

xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4= independent variable 


E = random error in prediction, that is variance that cannot be accurately predicted by the model. Also known as residuals.

B0 = y-intercept at time zero.

B1 = regression coefficient that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi1 changes.

B2 = coefficient value that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi2 changes.

For Example: Predicting Salary of employees based on work experience, Degree, qualifications etc.


# Multiple Lineae Regression Assumptions:

1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables.

2. The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.

3. yi observations are selected independently and randomly from the population.

4. Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance σ .
